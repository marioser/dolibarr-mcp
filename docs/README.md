# Documentation

The Dolibarr MCP repository mirrors the documentation layout of the
`prestashop-mcp` project. Start with the quickstart and branch into specialised
guides as needed:

- [Quickstart](quickstart.md) – installation and first run instructions for Linux, macOS and Windows
- [Configuration](configuration.md) – environment variables consumed by the server
- [Development](development.md) – running tests, optional Docker assets and contributor workflow
- [API Coverage](api-reference.md) – overview of the Dolibarr REST resources exposed via MCP tools
