[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format.

### Added
- Restored README.md and CHANGELOG.md after merge conflicts while preserving the streamlined structure shared with `prestashop-mcp`.
- Documented platform-specific setup covering Linux/macOS shells, Windows Visual Studio `vsenv`, and the Docker workflow.

### Changed

### Removed

## [1.1.0] - 2024-05-22

### Removed
- Legacy helper scripts, installers, and manual test programs that duplicated the automated test-suite.
- Alternative server implementations (`simple_client`, `standalone_server`, `ultra_simple_server`) in favour of the single `dolibarr_mcp_server`.
- Redundant documentation fragments and variant requirements files that no longer reflected the current project layout.

### Changed
- Rewrote the README to highlight the streamlined structure and provide concise installation/run instructions.
- Clarified that `dolibarr_mcp_server.py` is the definitive MCP entry point.
